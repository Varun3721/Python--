#Exception are run time error and we need to handle them

#Syntax_Time_Error is the error which makes not at all running of program
#While Run_Time_Error is the error which makes run of program but suddenly abnormally stops

a=int(input("enter first no. "))
b=int(input("enter second no. "))

c=a//b

print(c)
# print(M) #creates run time error and it will show Traceback (most recent call last):

#also if you do some syntax error like it will not
# if a>b:
# print("hello ")


#a logical error is the one where we are not getting desired result ok.

#its all because you put wrong logic and thinking of desired result haha
